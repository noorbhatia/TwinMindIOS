# Known Issues & Limitations

## Overview

This document outlines the current limitations, known issues, and areas for improvement in the TwinMindAssignment iOS audio recording application. Understanding these constraints helps prioritize future development efforts and sets realistic expectations for the application's capabilities.

### 1. Live Transcription

**Issue**: Live transcription is not available right now

**Missing Features**:
- Perform live transcription using apple Speech


### 2. Terminated transcriptions

**Issue**: App doesn't transribe correctly after a session is terminated in the middle
**Missing Features**:
- Should queue terminated sessions for transcriptions

### 3. Transcription Quality Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Variable Transcription Quality
- **Description**: Accuracy varies significantly with audio quality, background noise, and speaker characteristics
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with low-quality transcriptions
- **Severity**: Medium

**Factors Affecting Quality**:
- Background noise levels
- Speaker accent and clarity
- Audio compression artifacts
- Network latency affecting audio upload

**Improvement Needed**: Audio preprocessing and quality assessment before transcription(add noise gate and filters)

## Data Management Issues

### 1. Storage Space Management

**Issue**: Insufficient Storage Cleanup
- **Description**: Audio files accumulate without automatic cleanup policies
- **Impact**: Device storage exhaustion
- **Current State**: Manual cleanup only

**Missing Features**:
- Automatic cleanup of old recordings
- Intelligent storage management based on usage patterns
- Compressed audio storage options
- Cloud backup integration

### 2. Data Synchronization

**Issue**: No Multi-Device Synchronization
- **Description**: Recordings are device-specific with no cloud sync
- **Impact**: Data loss on device replacement/reset
- **Current State**: Local storage only

**Required Implementation**:
- iCloud sync for metadata
- CloudKit integration for cross-device access
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Selective sync based on user preferences


## User Interface Limitations

### 1. Accessibility Support

**Issue**: Incomplete Accessibility Implementation
- **Description**: Missing VoiceOver labels and accessibility hints
- **Current State**: Basic accessibility support

**Missing Features**:
- Custom accessibility actions
- Haptic feedback for recording states
- Voice-controlled recording commands
- Screen reader optimized navigation

### 2. Internationalization

**Issue**: Limited Language Support
- **Description**: UI text is hardcoded in English
- **Impact**: Unusable for non-English speakers
- **Current State**: English only

**Required Work**:
- String localization for all UI text
- RTL language support
- Locale-specific date/time formatting
- Cultural considerations for audio recording

### 3. Adaptive UI for Different Screen Sizes

**Issue**: Non-Optimized iPad Experience
- **Description**: UI designed primarily for iPhone
- **Impact**: Suboptimal experience on iPad
- **Severity**: Low
- **Current State**: Basic responsiveness

**Improvements Needed**:
- iPad-specific layouts
- Split-screen support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- External keyboard support


## Security & Privacy Concerns

### 1. Audio Data Encryption

**Issue**: Incomplete Data Encryption
- **Description**: Audio files stored without encryption at rest
- **Impact**: Potential data exposure if device is compromised
- **Severity**: High
- **Current State**: No encryption

**Required Implementation**:
- File-level encryption using iOS Data Protection
- Encrypted database storage
- Secure audio transmission

## Development & Maintenance Issues

### 2. Testing Coverage

**Issue**: Incomplete Test Coverage
- **Description**: Limited unit and integration tests
- **Impact**: Higher risk of regressions
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Current State**: Basic test structure

**Testing Gaps**:
- Audio processing edge cases
- Network failure scenarios
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing
