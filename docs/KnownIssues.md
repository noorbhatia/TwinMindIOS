# Known Issues & Limitations

## Overview

This document outlines the current limitations, known issues, and areas for improvement in the TwinMindAssignment iOS audio recording application. Understanding these constraints helps prioritize future development efforts and sets realistic expectations for the application's capabilities.

## Audio System Limitations

### 1. Background Recording Constraints

**Issue**: iOS Background Audio Processing Limitations
- **Description**: iOS restricts background audio processing to 30 seconds without proper background app refresh
- **Impact**: Extended recording sessions may be interrupted when app enters background
- **Severity**: High
- **Workaround**: 
  - Enable Background App Refresh in device settings
  - Implement background task management with BGTaskScheduler
  - Show user notification when background recording is about to end

**Current Implementation Status**: ⚠️ Partially Implemented
```swift
// Current limitation in BackgroundTaskManager
func beginBackgroundTask() {
    // Limited to 30 seconds by iOS
    backgroundTask = UIApplication.shared.beginBackgroundTask {
        self.endBackgroundTask()
    }
}
```

**Proposed Solution**:
```swift
// Enhanced background processing with BGTaskScheduler
func scheduleBackgroundRecording() {
    let request = BGAppRefreshTaskRequest(identifier: "com.twinmind.recording")
    request.earliestBeginDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 15 * 60) // 15 minutes
    
    try? BGTaskScheduler.shared.submit(request)
}
```

### 2. Audio Route Change Recovery

**Issue**: Inconsistent Recovery from Complex Route Changes

### 3. Memory Usage with Large Audio Files

**Issue**: Memory Pressure with Extended Recordings
- **Description**: Long recording sessions (>1 hour) may cause memory pressure on older devices
- **Impact**: App termination or performance degradation
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Devices**: iPhone 12 and older with limited RAM

**Current Mitigation**:
```swift
// Basic memory management in AudioRecorderEngine
func processAudioBuffer(_ buffer: AVAudioPCMBuffer) {
    // Process in chunks to avoid memory buildup
    autoreleasepool {
        // Buffer processing for waveform visualization
        let level = calculateAudioLevel(from: buffer)
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.audioLevel = level
            self.audioSamples.append(normalized)
            
            // Limit audioSamples array size
            if self.audioSamples.count > 50 {
                self.audioSamples.removeFirst(self.audioSamples.count - 50)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
